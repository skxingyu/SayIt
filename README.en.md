# SayIt

**Just say it, and write well**

Open-source voice typing for Windows. Press a shortcut and speak—SayIt transcribes, cleans up, and inserts polished text wherever your cursor is.

> ### ⚠️ Personal customized fork notice
>
> This repository is a **personal fork of [`crosswk/SayIt`](https://github.com/crosswk/SayIt)**, customized by `skxingyu` to suit personal preferences in a specific direction. It is not the upstream release and is not maintained as a general distribution. For the official feature set and changelog, see the upstream project.
>
> **Special thanks to the original author [@crosswk](https://github.com/crosswk)**: SayIt and its excellent design are entirely the work of the original author. This project is a personal branch built on top of that work, and we sincerely thank them for it. 🙏
>
> Speech recognition in this version uses the **local model "qwen3 ASR 1.7B-提速版 (speed-boosted)"** for offline inference on the local GPU.
>
> **Changes vs. upstream (v0.1.9-1):**
> - **Enhanced number normalization**: in addition to converting Chinese numeral words to Arabic digits, supports digit-by-digit spoken runs (e.g. 「一零零二三」→ `10023`, plain 「一二三四五」→ `12345`) and ordinal forms like 「第 N 个/名/号/批/轮/期/章/节/条/目/页/项」. These follow personal taste. See [`textPostProcess.ts`](client/src/services/textPostProcess.ts) and its [unit tests](client/src/services/__tests__/textPostProcess.test.ts).

## Why SayIt?

Typing is often the slowest part of working with AI. SayIt turns speech into text you can use immediately, while keeping the important choices in your hands:

- **Voice typing anywhere** — dictate into editors, chat apps, browsers, and other Windows software.
- **Editable AI cleanup** — remove filler words, repair recognition errors, format ideas, or keep a faithful transcript. Every prompt is yours to change.
- **Context-aware writing** (off by default) — reads the text around your cursor so new dictation matches its tone and terminology. Select text first and your speech becomes an editing instruction—translate, tighten, rewrite, or ask a question—replacing the selection directly. Password fields are skipped.
- **Flexible speech recognition** — use a cloud ASR provider, run a local GGUF model on your own GPU, connect to the public trial server, or host your own backend.
- **English and Chinese interface** — the UI follows your system language and can be switched at any time.
- **Hotwords and per-app rules** — improve names and technical terms, then change cleanup behavior automatically for different apps.
- **Overlay feedback** — a small waveform overlay shows recording state and elapsed time, with optional live captions while you speak.
- **Transparent data flow** — the app shows which mode is active and where audio and text are processed.
- **Local history and diagnostics** — review recordings, re-transcribe them, and collect useful troubleshooting details without guesswork.

## Choose how it runs

| Mode | Best for | Data flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Local mode** | Privacy and offline use | Speech recognition stays on your PC. With AI cleanup off, nothing leaves the device. |
| **Cloud API mode** | The best balance for personal use | Your PC talks directly to the ASR and AI providers you configure. No SayIt server is involved. |
| **Server mode** | Teams and managed deployments | Audio is processed by a SayIt backend you control—or by the public trial server for a quick start. |

Local recognition ships seven GGUF models, with GPU acceleration when available: Parakeet Unified EN (fastest and most accurate for English), SenseVoice Small, Fun-ASR Nano, Nemotron 3.5 ASR (32 languages), and three Qwen3-ASR sizes. Cloud recognition supports Doubao, Qwen, Xiaomi MiMo, and Groq Whisper; AI cleanup works with DeepSeek, Qwen, Groq, MiMo, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Get started

1. Download the latest [Windows installer](https://github.com/crosswk/SayIt/releases/latest).
2. Open SayIt and choose a voice engine. The default public server is enough for a quick trial.
3. Press the configured shortcut in any app and speak. By default you press once to start and again to finish; hold-to-talk is available too, under a separate shortcut.

For regular use, choose Local mode or add your own cloud provider keys from the in-app settings. The provider console links are available beside each key field.

## Self-hosting

The backend combines FastAPI, WebSocket streaming, Qwen3-ASR, and an optional OpenAI-compatible cleanup model. Docker Compose is the recommended deployment path.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crosswk/SayIt.git
cd SayIt/server
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
cp .env.example .env
# Add your provider and deployment settings to .env/config.yaml
docker compose up -d --build
```

GPU speech recognition requires an NVIDIA GPU; 16 GB or more of VRAM is recommended for the default server model. See the [server guide](server/README.md) for configuration, deployment, security, and API details.

## Performance reference

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B with vLLM on an AWS EC2 `g5.xlarge` (NVIDIA A10G 24 GB):

| Audio length | ASR latency | RTF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30 seconds | ~0.8 s | 0.025 |
| 1 minute | ~1.6 s | 0.026 |
| 2 minutes | ~2.1 s | 0.017 |
| 3 minutes | ~2.5 s | 0.014 |
| 5 minutes | ~3.0 s | 0.010 |

## Development

### Desktop client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Requirements: Node.js 18+, Rust 1.75+, CMake 3.20+, and the Vulkan SDK. The first native build compiles the C++ speech engine and may take around 20 minutes; later builds use the cache.

On non-English Windows installations, set `CL=/utf-8` before building so MSVC reads UTF-8 source files correctly.

### Server

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

Requirements: Python 3.10+ and, for GPU inference, an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA.
